# Harvest Tycoon — September 17 update

## Beginner guide alignment fix

Reward text now uses dedicated text elements, so icon replacement cannot duplicate it inside the diamond sprite. The guide has consistent padding, a flexible progress bar, an always-visible count, contained action buttons and a correctly sized reward icon. All other features from the full September 17 update are included. This is a frontend-only fix; no Supabase update is needed.

## Included

- A new English welcome page with a large original logo, sharp farm illustration, feature icons and a responsive account card.
- An independent Beginner guide with 10 simple steps, separate from all 41 regular quests and daily challenges.
- One reward of 20 diamonds when the tenth beginner step is completed. Progress and reward eligibility are validated by the server.
- A mobile beginner banner and Show me buttons that open the relevant tools or building.
- More space between useful buildings, small work yards and extra props beside paths. All building functions remain available.
- An overview that fits the main buildings and fields, plus a Fields button to focus on crops. My farm / Show the whole farm returns to the overview.
- A centered mobile daily-gift icon and corrected singular-day wording.

Supabase project `jnmdirvidffzxukbdmij` already runs the updated `farm-api` version 2. Its deployed source was compared with this package. No database migration or authentication change is needed. Do not rerun the old setup SQL.

## Verified scope

- 52 automated tests pass, including a complete beginner journey, one-time reward, rejected skipped steps, saved progress, and preservation of regular quest progress.
- The static Vercel production build passes.
- The deployed Supabase function is ACTIVE with JWT verification enabled and matches the included function sources.
- The GitHub integration rejected writes with HTTP 403, “Resource not accessible by integration”. No frontend commit was pushed by ChatGPT.
- Local browser preview was blocked. The new frontend has not been visually checked on Vercel yet; upload is required before that check can happen.
